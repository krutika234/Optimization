# Optimization

Tutorial on optimization has three parts as separted on the basis of library. 

1. The first part is a basic tutorial on linear programming using the library pulp.

2. The second part is based on the library scipy.optimization. A very basic and percise tutorial on solving and modeling 
of the problem
https://colab.research.google.com/github/krutika234/Optimization/blob/master/optimization_with_scipy%20.ipynb

3. The third part will give you a brief introduction to use the library cvxopt for convex optimization
